// REMINDER
// Types are an easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has

const today = new Date();
today.getMonth();

const person = {
	age: 20
};

class Color {

}
const red = new Color();
// if you leave this blank, there are no properties applied to Color, but if you add them within the {}, they will show on red.asjdkfljaskl

// where would you use types in a project? 
// everywhere lol
